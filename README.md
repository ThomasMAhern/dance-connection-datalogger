# dance-connection-datalogger
Device that records pressure-sensor and gyro data during a dance to evaluate and characterize tension and compression during a partner dance.

Parts required:
1. $20 - [Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2796)
2. $12 - [Adafruit LSM6DSOX 6 DoF Accelerometer and Gyroscope](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4438)
3. $1 - [Through-Hole Resistors - 10K ohm 5% 1/4W](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2784)
4. $7 - [LIPO Battery w JST connector - 3.7V 400mAh](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3898) - ensure correct JST polarity - you'll kill the Adalogger :(
5. $9 - [MicroSD card](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1294) - this is trial and error as many don't work with the Adalogger :(
6. $4 - [Force-Sensitive Resistor (FSR)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/166) (still testing out the best ones)
