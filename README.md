# dance-connection-datalogger
Device that records pressure-sensor and gyro data during a dance to evaluate and characterize tension and compression during a partner dance.

You'll have to solder some of the components together, and then load the code onto the Adalogger via [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) + micro usb. You can follow [this guide](https://github.com/ThomasMAhern/dance-connection-datalogger/blob/main/A%20guide%20to%20testing_%20connecting%20and%20completing%20the%20project..pdf).


## Parts required:
* $20 - [Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2796)
* $12 - [Adafruit LSM6DSOX 6 DoF Accelerometer and Gyroscope](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4438)
* $1 - [Through-Hole Resistors - 10K ohm 5% 1/4W](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2784)
* $7 - [LIPO Battery w JST connector - 3.7V 400mAh](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3898) - ensure correct JST polarity - you'll kill the Adalogger :(
* $4 - [Force-Sensitive Resistor (FSR)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/166) (still testing out the best ones, but 20kg is best so far)
* $1 - [Stemma QT JST SH 4-Pin 1.0mm pitch Cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4399)
* $9 - [MicroSD card](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1294) - format to ExFAT32, some don't work with the Adalogger **(8MB/hr)**
   * Amazon Basics v30 üü® (works sometimes)
   * Gigastone v30 ‚úÖ
   * Prograde v60 ‚úÖ
   * Verbatim V10 ‚úÖ
   * Kootion ‚ùå
   * Netac V10 ‚úÖ

## Soldering kit:
If you're new to soldering, I would recommend: 
* $26 - [Pinecil USB-C powered Soldering Iron](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/) (I think it requires a 60W USB-C PD cable)
* $11 - [TS-BC2 soldering tip](https://a.co/d/acchofP)
* $40 - [KESTER SOLDER 24-6337-0027 Solder Wire](https://a.co/d/aGZpqEn) (leaded solder is SO much easier to work with)
* $38 - [Omnifixio OF-S2 third hand](https://omnifixo.com/collections/all) (not required, but holds components in place during soldering)

## About the data:
Once you've made some recordings, I use [this Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ThomasMAhern/dance-connection-datalogger/blob/main/Dance_Connection_Datalogger_Code.ipynb) to analyze the data and get the interactive graphs.

Here is a short recording showing 8 claps for sync, and then light, medium, and heavy connection against a doorframe:

You want to use KT tape to secure the sensor to your finger. The elastic band I tried kept moving/slipping during even sugar tucks. You can see the result in this graph as the band kept needing to be adjusted (in this case I feel like it was slowly wrapping around my finger causing slightly more tension:

This graph shows a single dance, where it kept moving and had to adjust it halfway through - thus ruining a good baseline:

Contrasted to the first night where I used KT tape, while it loosened up and I needed to adjust it in the beginning, it stayed relatively constant afterwards (This was also using a 6kg sensor):

I'd eventually like to have something similar to [this video](https://youtu.be/6ijArKE8vKU?si=1VSgT_-CmVnYFNdb&t=132).

#### Future ideas: 
* Show difference between beginner/experienced connection smoothness
* Classify different patterns based on Accelerometer + Gyro readings
* Vector Database showing which pro your connection/patterns/etc. are most similar to
* Quantify connection quality during comps
* Marcus S. also suggested the idea for using it to display foot data when pushing into the floor. We could potentially use velostat material as the insert material, or just multiple sensors
